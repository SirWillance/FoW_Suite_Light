"""
Force of Will Suite Light - Base Weight Node

This is the base class for all weight-related nodes in the Force of Will (FoW) Suite Light tier, like the foundation of your guild’s strength boosters in ComfyUI. It provides common functionality for applying weights to conditioning inputs, enhancing raw prompts for beginners with simple adjustments (no sliders or customization in Light—upgrade to Pro (€25) or Ultimate (€100) for advanced weighting). It’s your starting armor for weights like `SubjectWeight` or `StyleWeight` in `FoW_Suite_LIGHT`.

Note:
    Install via ComfyUI Manager (“Install Custom Nodes” → “Force of Will Suite Light”) or clone from GitHub (https://github.com/SirWillance/FoW_Suite_LIGHT). Help me level up on Twitch (https://www.twitch.tv/sirwillance) for free `FoW_Suite_Standard` (€15) via Discord (https://discord.gg/BHSxf8HB)!
